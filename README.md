# Smart-Student-Result-Analyzer
Smart Student Result Analyzer: Built a Python application to analyze student marks, calculate grades, identify weak subjects, and determine class toppers using core data structures and functions.


Project Description – Smart Student Result Analyzer

The Smart Student Result Analyzer is a beginner-level Python application designed to automate the analysis of student academic performance. The system collects student marks across multiple subjects and processes them to generate meaningful results.

The program calculates total marks, average score, grade, and pass/fail status for each student. It also identifies weak subjects where students score below the minimum passing mark and determines the class topper based on the highest average.
